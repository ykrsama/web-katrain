# Deployment

Web KaTrain is a static Vite app. A production build emits `dist/`, which can be
served by GitHub Pages or any static host that can serve JavaScript, WASM,
compressed model files, and the service worker.

## Build

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

The build runs:

- TypeScript project build.
- Vite production build.
- Version metadata generation at `dist/version.json`.
- Copy/download prebuild hooks for TensorFlow.js WASM files and the small model.

Preview the result:

```sh
npm run preview
```

## Base Path

`vite.config.ts` computes the Vite base path in this order:

1. `VITE_BASE_URL`
2. `BASE_URL`
3. The GitHub repository name from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
4. `/`

The value is normalized to start and end with `/`. For a repository named
`web-katrain`, GitHub Pages builds use `/web-katrain/`.

Use an explicit base path when deploying somewhere unusual:

```sh
VITE_BASE_URL=/my/path/ npm run build
```

## Analysis Visit Cap

The browser engine refuses to start a search deeper than `ENGINE_MAX_VISITS`
(`src/engine/katago/limits.ts`), which defaults to 500,000 visits. It bounds one
analysis request only: the depth selector, the Settings visits fields, and every
engine call derive their limit from it.

Override the default at build time when you want a lower ceiling (for weaker
devices) or a higher one:

```sh
VITE_KATAGO_MAX_VISITS=250000 npm run build
```

The value must be a positive integer; anything else falls back to 500,000.

## Analysis Time Cap

The browser engine also refuses to search longer than `ENGINE_MAX_TIME_MS`
(`src/engine/katago/limits.ts`), which defaults to 10 minutes. Every engine call
clamps its own maximum time to it, so a large visit cap only matters if the time
cap is raised to match.

Override the default at build time:

```sh
VITE_KATAGO_MAX_TIME_MS=1200000 npm run build
```

The value is a positive integer in milliseconds; anything else falls back to
600,000 (10 minutes).

## GitHub Pages

The repository includes `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`. On pushes to
`main` or manual dispatch, it:

1. Checks out the repository with LFS enabled.
2. Sets up Node 24 with npm caching.
3. Runs `npm ci`.
4. Runs `npm run audit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and
   `npm run test:typecheck`. A failure in any of them stops the deploy.
5. Runs `npm run build`.
6. Uploads `dist/` as a Pages artifact.
7. Deploys through `actions/deploy-pages`.

The gates in step 4 are the same checks `npm run` offers locally, in the same
order web-chess uses, so a green local run means a green deploy. Note that
gating on `npm run audit` means a new advisory in a dependency can block a
release without any app code changing — if that happens, it is a real signal,
but it is not a build failure.

The current live URL is:

## Headers

For best WASM performance, serve these headers:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

They enable `SharedArrayBuffer`, which TensorFlow.js WASM uses for threaded
execution.

The Vite dev and preview servers set the headers. The production build ships
`public/_headers`:

```text
/*
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Hosts such as Netlify and Cloudflare Pages can honor that file. GitHub Pages
does not support custom response headers, so WASM runs single-threaded there.
The app still works, and WebGPU is unaffected by this limitation.

## Service Worker and Offline Cache

The production app registers `sw.js` after page load. Development builds do not
register the service worker.

The service worker precaches:

- The app shell.
- Manifest and PWA icons/screenshots.
- The small default model.
- TensorFlow.js WASM files.
- Built-in board and stone assets.

Navigation requests fall back to the cached app shell when offline. Static
assets are cache-first. Other same-origin GET requests are cached at runtime.

## Updates

The build emits `version.json` with package version, git hash, commit date, and
build date. Production clients poll that file periodically and on window focus.
When a new git hash is detected, the app can show an update-ready banner.

The service worker also listens for `SKIP_WAITING`, allowing the UI to activate
a waiting worker and reload.

## Static Host Checklist

- Serve `index.html`, `404.html`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js`, model files,
  WASM files, and generated JS/CSS from the same origin.
- Preserve `.gz` model files as files; do not decompress or block them.
- Use the correct Vite base path for subdirectory deployments.
- Add COOP/COEP headers when the host supports them.
- Make sure `404.html` is deployed for SPA fallback on hosts that need it.
